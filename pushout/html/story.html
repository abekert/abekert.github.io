        <h1>Game Developer Story</h1>
        
        <div id="developer-photo"></div>
        <p>Hello! My name is Alexander Bekert, and I am 22 years old. I am originally from a belarusian town by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polotsk">Polotsk</a>, it is relatively small in size but huge in its history.</p>
        
        <p>The initial idea of Push Out came to me while I was attending a boring university lecture. Like in any typical lecture, I saw people in the first row that were at least pretending to pay attention while the people in the back were bluntly staring at their smartphones only to catch up on the recent social media updates and to listen to music. The person right next to me was jumping from one roof to another in a new viral game. These observations made me conclude that technology should bring people together as opposed to making us isolated form another. However, because of the lecture was truly boring I had no other choice but to watch my neighbour was trying to set another record in his game. My only regret was the inability to join him in playing the game, after all, there is enough screen space to fit two players to unite us in an enjoyable game; however, the controls then have to be made a way simpler… This is when I finally realised what kind of game I actually wanted to make.</p>
        
        <p>The prototyping of the game took 2 days and visually everything looked as follows: a floating square platform contained four rotating circles. Every circle is controlled by a touch zone on the screen. The goal of the game was to push other circles out of the platform. Just wait for the correct direction and knock out these circles. The winner is the one whose circle is the last one on the screen. A little competitive match amongst friends!
Of course, for a game it was too simple of a concept so there was a whole year of hard meticulous labor before the final edition of Push Out came about.</p>

        <p>Game creation is an art in itself never created by one person. Even a good painting has a master who carefully cuts the frame and mounts the canvas on it.</p>
        
        <p>I was that master. The painting itself was done by Tatsiana Volkova. When I say she painted it, I really mean it. Every character, every shot was hand drawn on a piece of paper and added to the game because of her. It is because of Tatsiana the game is vivid in colors and simple shapes are replaced with turtles and crackers. Objects in the game are suspended on strings similarly to dolls in a puppet theatre.</p>

        <p>This was the slow and methodical process behind the game becoming alive. Too slow… The person who helped us speed up the process was Pavel Ignatovich with his light and entertaining jingles.</p>

        <p>The final creation is mounted on the wall for everyone to see. The person who made this possible was Roman Shabohin whose fast and elegant execution resulted in an amazing website complementing the game.</p>
        
        <p>It is with this small team that the game Push Out came to be. Allow the game to unite you with others, let it entertain you with unusual characters and guitar jungles. Compete with your friends with joy…</p>
